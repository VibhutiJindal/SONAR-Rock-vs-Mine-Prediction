# SONAR-Rock-vs-Mine-Prediction
There is war is going on between two countries.

Movement by air is impossible due to detection missiles.

Moving by land is too slow and very dangerous.

The submarine of one country is going under the water to another country.

The enemy country has planted some mines in the ocean.

The mines are explodes when some object comes in contact with it.

The ocean also contains rocks.

The submarine needs to predict the object that it is crossing. is it mine or rock?

The submarine uses sonar signal that sends sound and receives switchbacks.

This signal in the processed to detect whether the object is a mine or or a rock in the ocean.
